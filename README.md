Hello! 
This is my project which I started to make it for a years ago.

Download all of these files and extract anywhere you want, then run the .bat file called test.bat. Next, run the opinion 3 to make sure all of the important python modules are installed. And you have 2 of opinions about the type of roblox: VNG and global. Run the opinions of the emulator you use (and the type of roblox too):
