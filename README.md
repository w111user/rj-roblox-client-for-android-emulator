# Rejoin roblox client for android emulator

Hello! 👋  
This is my project, which I started about a year ago.

You are free to **use, remake, or copy** this project.  
However, **please credit me as the author** if you use it in your own project. :3  
Have fun! 😊

## 📌 How to use

1. Download all files and extract them anywhere you want.
2. Run the `.bat` file named **`test.bat`**.
3. Choose **option 3** first to make sure all required Python modules are installed.
4. Select:
   - The **Android emulator** you are using
   - The **Roblox version** you want to run (**Global** or **VNG**)

Some files that are temporary, ignore it or do anythings you want :)
